The movie database app is a challenge I made using The Movie Database API and React.js. On this application you will see movies ordered by popularity. Also, you can search for a movie by title, and you can see more details of a particular movie, just clicking on its poster or image. 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In order to try it, you can clon or download it. 
In the project directory, you can run: -npm install-, through the console. 
Then, you can run the app in the development mode: -npm start- and, finally, open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser
